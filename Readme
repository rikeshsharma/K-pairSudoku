For Q1, We have file "solver.py". 
To execute this, in command line give command
    > python3 ./solver.py
Then give the file name that has input sudoku. For testing on a given test file like "test5.csv" input : tests/test5.csv
Input file should be of the format:
    1. k
    2...k^2+1 lines will have first sudoku with digits comma saperated, each line contains one row of sudoku.
    k^2+2...2*k^2+1 lines will have second sudoku with digits comma saperated, each line contains one row of sudoku.
In place of holes will be zero.
If the input file has name "inpfile.csv" then the output file will be of name "out_inpfile.csv". This file will be of format:
    1...k^2 lines will have first sudoku with digits comma saperated, each line contains one row of sudoku.
    k^2+1...2*k^2 lines will have second sudoku with digits comma saperated, each line contains one row of sudoku.

For Q2, We have file "generator.py"
To execute this, in command line give command
    > python3 ./generator.py
Then give the value of "k" as an integer.
The program will produce a output file whose name is "outputk.csv" where k is the given input integer.
The output file will be of the format:
    1. k
    2...k^2+1 lines will have first sudoku with digits comma saperated, each line contains one row of sudoku.
    k^2+2...2*k^2+1 lines will have second sudoku with digits comma saperated, each line contains one row of sudoku.
In place of holes will be zero.

The folder "tests" contains 5 test cases for Q1 "solver.py".
The folder "Output" contains 5 expected ouputs with "outi.csv" being output of "testi.csv" for Q1 "solver.py".
